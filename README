About OpenVAS Manager
---------------------

The OpenVAS Manager is a layer between the OpenVAS Scanner and various
client applications such as the web client GSA (Greenbone Security
Assistant), the command line client omp (of openvas-cli) and the classic
application GSD (Greenbone Security Desktop).  Among other features, it
adds server-side storage of scan results and it removes the need for a scan
client to keep the connection open until the scan finishes.  All
communication between OpenVAS Manager and its clients is done via the
XML-based OpenVAS Management Protocol (OMP).

OpenVAS Manager is licensed under GNU General Public License Version 2 or
any later version.  Please see file COPYING for details.

Howto use
---------

Note:
The Manager connects to the scanner using certificate based authentication.
The certificate needs to be created for this communication.
Please see the file INSTALL for instructions.

Starting OpenVAS Manager:
For example, if openvassd is running on port 9391, the following command
starts the Manager on port 9390.

    openvasmd

A command like

    openvasmd --update

or

    openvasmd --rebuild

will update the Manager's NVT cache, and then exit.  The cache must be
updated every time the Scanner syncs with the NVT feed.  The --rebuild
option is faster as it locks the database the entire time, whereas --update
allows clients to access the Manager during the update.

A rebuild within a running Manager can also be invoked by sending the main
Manager process the SIGHUP signal (signal number 1).
