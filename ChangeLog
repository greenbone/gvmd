	CMakeLists.txt.

2015-04-14  Timo Pollmeier <timo.pollmeier@greenbone.net>

	Backport r21687, excluding unsupported option "scanner".

	* src/manage.c (slave_setup): Set task preferences/options alterable,
	in_assets, source_iface and hosts_ordering. Initialize other fields
	of opts with NULL.

2015-04-14  Hani Benhabiles  <hani.benhabiles@greenbone.net>

	Backport parts of r21567.

	* src/lsc_user.c (create_ssh_key): New function.
	(ssh_privkey_create, ssh_pubkey_create): Remove functions.
	(lsc_user_keys_create): Adjust function to use create_ssh_key()
	accordingly to create a private key.

	* src/lsc_user.h: Adjust function header.

2015-04-14  Timo Pollmeier <timo.pollmeier@greenbone.net>

	Backport r21601.

	* src/manage.c (slave_setup): Add options exclude_hosts, alive_test,
	reverse_lookup_only and reverse_lookup_unify when creating target.
	Rename fail_credential label to fail_smb_credential.

2015-04-14  Timo Pollmeier <timo.pollmeier@greenbone.net>

	Backport r22076.

	* src/manage_sql.c (report_counts_match): Add missing quotes around oid
	value in search_phrase && search_phrase_exact case.

2015-02-18  Matthew Mundell <matthew.mundell@greenbone.net>

	predefined report formats.

2015-03-04  Michael Wiegand <michael.wiegand@greenbone.net>

	Post release version bump.

	* CMakeLists.txt: Updated version number to 5.0.10.

2015-03-04  Michael Wiegand <michael.wiegand@greenbone.net>

	Preparing the openvas-manager 5.0.9 release.

	* CHANGES: Updated.

	* CMakeLists.txt: Raise minimum required version of openvas-libraries
	to 7.0.8.

	* INSTALL: Update version requirements to match change to
	CMakeLists.txt.

2015-02-19  Timo Pollmeier <timo.pollmeier@greenbone.net>

	Backport r21673 without the min_qod part.

	* src/manage_sql.c (report_scan_result_count): Use cached count
	if min_cvss_base and search_phrase are empty strings, not only if
	they are NULL.

2015-02-19  Timo Pollmeier <timo.pollmeier@greenbone.net>

	Backport r21643.
	Change in src/manage_sqlite3.c is applied to src/manage_sql.c instead.
	The change in src/manage_pg.c does not apply.

	* src/manage_sql.c (create_tables): Create new index
	report_counts_by_report_and_override.

2015-02-16  Matthew Mundell <matthew.mundell@greenbone.net>

	Backport r21655.

	* src/manage.c (manage_schedule): Remove the check that ensures that a
	periodic task is started within a short interval at the scheduled start
	time.  This check was meant to prevent the task from starting long after
	the scheduled start time but I do not see a real problem with this
	happening, and the check could cause the run to be missed entirely when
	the machine is heavily loaded.

2015-02-12  Matthew Mundell <matthew.mundell@greenbone.net>

	Backport r21634.

	* src/manage.c (update_end_times): Skip setting the times if the strings
	are empty or only contain space, otherwise the time parser logs a
	warning.

2015-02-10  Matthew Mundell <matthew.mundell@greenbone.net>

	Backport r21583.

	* src/manage.c (slave_setup): Also specify the SSH port when creating the
	target.

2015-02-05  Matthew Mundell <matthew.mundell@greenbone.net>

	Backport r21568.

	* src/manage.c (manage_schedule): Use the correct case for parent and
	child, otherwise the parent aborts when it runs SQL because the
	fork_connection function closes the SQL connection for the child.

2015-02-04  Matthew Mundell <matthew.mundell@greenbone.net>

	Backport r21559.

	* src/manage.c (slave_ssh_credential_uuid, slave_smb_credential_uuid)
	(slave_target_uuid, slave_config_uuid, slave_task_uuid)
	(slave_report_uuid, slave_session, slave_socket): New variables.
	(cleanup_slave): New function.
	(slave_setup): Use new variables.  Register cleanup_slave as atexit
	function, so that the slave task is stopped if Manager is terminated.

2015-02-02  Matthew Mundell <matthew.mundell@greenbone.net>

	Backport r21541.

	* src/manage_sql.c (where_search_phrase): Warn about relation to
	report_counts_match.
	(report_counts_match): Use the same conditions that are used in the
	result iterator.  This was causing errors in the filtered counts in
	reports when certain filter terms were given.

2015-01-29  Michael Wiegand <michael.wiegand@greenbone.net>

	Post release version bump.

	* CMakeLists.txt: Updated version number to 5.0.9.

2015-01-29  Michael Wiegand <michael.wiegand@greenbone.net>

	Preparing the openvas-manager 5.0.8 release.

	* CHANGES: Updated.

	* CMakeLists.txt: Raise minimum required version of openvas-libraries
	to 7.0.7.

	* INSTALL: Update version requirements to match change to
	CMakeLists.txt.

2015-01-29  Michael Wiegand <michael.wiegand@greenbone.net>

	Backport r21274 by Timo Pollmeier.

	* src/report_formats/HTML/HTML.xsl (note, override): Hide inactive
	notes / overrides. Use end_time instead of modification_time in
	"Active until:" part.

	* src/report_formats/LaTeX/latex.xsl (notes, overrides): Hide inactive
	notes / overrides.

	* src/report_formats/TXT/TXT.xsl (note, override): Hide inactive
	notes / overrides.

2015-01-29  Michael Wiegand <michael.wiegand@greenbone.net>

	Backport r21498 by Matthew Mundell.

	* src/manage_sql.c (escalate_1): Change Auto FP default to 0.

2015-01-28  Timo Pollmeier <timo.pollmeier@greenbone.net>

	Revert backport of r21100 because subsequent fixes for "analyze" and
	"vacuum" arguments of --optimize cannot be applied.

2015-01-27  Timo Pollmeier <timo.pollmeier@greenbone.net>

	Backport r21100 by Matthew Mundell.

	Add option --optimize, with arguments "analyze" and "vacuum".

	* src/omp.c (manage_optimize): New function.

	* src/manage.h: Add header accordingly.

	* src/openvasmd.c (main): Add --optimize.

2015-01-26  Matthew Mundell <matthew.mundell@greenbone.net>

	Backport r21483.

	* src/manage_sql.c (nvt_selector_family_count): Use a single statement
	for the static case, so that the DISTINCT can apply across both
	selections.  This catches the case where the config contains NVT
	selectors that are made redundant by family selections, like in the
	Greenbone Web Application XML.

2015-01-22  Matthew Mundell <matthew.mundell@greenbone.net>

	Backport r21473.

	* src/manage.c (slave_setup): Send Timeout prefs, as in GET_CONFIGS
	response.

2015-01-22  Matthew Mundell <matthew.mundell@greenbone.net>

	Backport r21469.

	Handle Timeout NVT preferences when importing configs.

	* src/omp.c (config_insert_preferences): Add Timeout case.

2015-01-22  Matthew Mundell <matthew.mundell@greenbone.net>

	Backport r21468.

	Include Timeout NVT preferences in GET_CONFIGS responses, but only if
	the timeout has been explicitly set by the user.

	* src/omp.c (omp_xml_handle_end_element): Send Timeout preferences in
	CLIENT_GET_CONFIGS.

	* src/manage_sql.c (init_config_timeout_iterator)
	(config_timeout_iterator_oid, config_timeout_iterator_nvt_name)
	(config_timeout_iterator_value): New functions.

	* src/manage.h: Add headers accordingly.

2015-01-21  Matthew Mundell <matthew.mundell@greenbone.net>

	Backport r21450.

	* src/omp.c (send_get_end): Include report in apply_override check, so
	that the report list also gets a default apply_overrides term when one
	is not given.

2015-01-20  Matthew Mundell <matthew.mundell@greenbone.net>

	Backport r21445.

	* src/manage_sql.c (setting_severity): Default to "nist" if the class is
	NULL, so that SQL functions in init_user_task_iterator work when called
	before authentication, like during --delete-user.

2015-01-14  Matthew Mundell <matthew.mundell@greenbone.net>

	Backport r21383.

	When the report format for an alert is not found in TEST_ALERT and
	GET_REPORTS, respond with a dedicated error message, instead of just
	with Internal Error.

	* src/manage_sql.c (escalate_2): Add new return for when report format
	is not found.
	(escalate_1, manage_alert): Doc new return.
	(manage_send_report): Separate alert errors.

	* src/omp.c (omp_xml_handle_end_element): In CLIENT_GET_REPORTS and
	CLIENT_TEST_ALERT handle new alert return values.

2015-01-08  Matthew Mundell <matthew.mundell@greenbone.net>

	Backport r21302.

	Use unsigned ints for retry variables, to avoid passing negatives to the
	sleep function.

	* src/sql.c (sqlv, sql_quiet, sql_x_internal, sql_prepare)
	(init_iterator): Use unsigned for retries.

	* src/manage_sql.c (init_prognosis_iterator, report_severity_data, clude)
	(create_agent): Use unsigned for retries.

2015-01-08  Matthew Mundell <matthew.mundell@greenbone.net>

	Backport r21290.

	* src/sql.c (sqlv, sql_quiet, sql_x_internal, sql_prepare)
	(init_interator): Sleep before retry.

	* src/manage_sql.c (init_prognosis_iterator, report_severity_data)
	(clude, create_agent): Sleep before retry.

2014-12-17  Matthew Mundell <matthew.mundell@greenbone.net>

	Backport r21225.

	* src/manage_acl.h (USER_MAY): Add missing subject_location test.

	* src/manage_acl.c (where_owned): Add subject_location tests for the
	permission part of the query too.

2014-12-17  Matthew Mundell <matthew.mundell@greenbone.net>

	Backport r21215.

	* src/manage_sql.c (user_can_everything)
	(user_has_access_uuid, where_owned): Add missing subject_location tests.
	Without these tests, permissions in the trashcan can randomly affect the
	rights that are assiged to users.

2014-12-05  Matthew Mundell <matthew.mundell@greenbone.net>

	Backport r21118.

	* src/manage_sql.c (manage_set_config_families): When modifying a family
	to include all NVTs, and the family does not grow, recalculate the value
	of the nvts_growing cache column.  Using the previous value gives the
	wrong value when the family being modified was previously the only
	growing family.

2014-12-05  Matthew Mundell <matthew.mundell@greenbone.net>

	Backport r21115.

	* src/manage_sql.c (manage_set_config_families): When modifying a family
	to include all NVTs, and the family does not grow, then use the previous
	value of the nvts_growing cache column.  Using 0 is correct for the
	family being modified, but there may be existing families that grow.

2014-12-04  Matthew Mundell <matthew.mundell@greenbone.net>

	Backport r21092.

	* src/omp.c (omp_xml_handle_end_element): In CLIENT_CREATE_TASK find the
	task with permission, in case the owner has given the user read access.

2014-12-03  Matthew Mundell <matthew.mundell@greenbone.net>

	Backport r21087.

	Enable mixing of the current users slaves and tasks, with other people's
	slaves and tasks, when permissions allow it.

	* src/manage_sql.c (init_slave_task_iterator): Get all tasks that use
	the slave.  Add a column to indicate whether the user has read access to
	the slave.
	(slave_task_iterator_readable, trash_slave_readable): New functions.

	* src/manage.c (run_task): Before forking, if task has slave and user is
	denied access to the slave, then return 99.

	* src/manage.h: Add headers accordingly.

	* src/manage_acl.c (where_owned): Add const to owner_filter arg.

	* src/manage_acl.h: Update header accordingly.

	* src/omp.c (omp_xml_handle_end_element): Send empty PERMISSIONS in
	TASK in GET_SLAVES when task is not readable.  Same for SLAVE in
	GET_TASKS when slave is not readable.  In CLIENT_MODIFY_TASK find the
	task with permission, in case the owner has granted MODIFY to the user.
	And find slave with permission, for same reason.

2014-12-01  Timo Pollmeier <timo.pollmeier@greenbone.net>

	Backport r21071.

	* src/manage_sql.c (credentials_setup): Get "Severity Class" and
	"Dynamic Severity" settings here for consistency with timezone setting.
	(authenticate): Remove queries for "Severity Class" and "Dynamic
	Severity" which are now sent by credentials_setup.

2014-12-01  Timo Pollmeier <timo.pollmeier@greenbone.net>

	Backport r21068.

	Cache "Severity Class" and "Dynamic Severity" settings in the
	current_credentials struct to reduce the amount of SQL queries by OMP
	commands like GET_REPORTS that frequently use these settings.

	* src/manage_sql.c (authenticate): Get "Severity Class" and
	"Dynamic Severity" setting for the credentials struct.
	(report_counts_id_filt, print_report_xml): Add const qualifier to
	local variables for Dynamic Severity setting and remove free / g_free.
	(setting_severity): Add const qualifier and get value from
	current_credentials.
	(setting_dynamic_severity_int): Get value from current_credentials.
	(modify_setting): Update current_credentials when setting Severity
	Class or Dynamic Severity.

	* src/manage.c (severity_in_level): Add const qualifier to variable
	"class" and remove g_free calls.

	* src/manage.h (severity_in_level): Add const qualifier.

	* src/omp.c (omp_xml_handle_end_element): In case CLIENT_AUTHENTICATE
	add const qualifier to variable "severity" and remove g_free calls.

2014-11-28  Michael Wiegand <michael.wiegand@greenbone.net>

	Post release version bump.

	* CMakeLists.txt: Updated version number to 5.0.8.

2014-11-28  Jan-Oliver Wagner <jan-oliver.wagner@greenbone.net>

	Preparing the openvas-manager 5.0.7 release.

	* CHANGES: Updated.

2014-11-28  Timo Pollmeier <timo.pollmeier@greenbone.net>

	Backport r21051.

	* src/manage_sql.c (create_schedule): Quote the timezone string for
	insert.

2014-11-27  Michael Wiegand <michael.wiegand@greenbone.net>

	Post release version bump.

	* CMakeLists.txt: Updated version number to 5.0.7.

2014-11-27  Michael Wiegand <michael.wiegand@greenbone.net>

	Preparing the openvas-manager 5.0.6 release.

	* CHANGES: Updated.

2014-11-25  Matthew Mundell <matthew.mundell@greenbone.net>

	Backport r20993.

	* src/manage_sql.c (credentials_setup): New function.
	(authenticate): Also do the credentials setup for authentications from
	task scheduling.

2014-11-25  Matthew Mundell <matthew.mundell@greenbone.net>

	Backport r20992.

	Retry starting of scheduled tasks when the start OMP fails.

	* src/manage.c (reschedule_task): New function.
	(manage_schedule): Do an extra fork and use the extra process to check
	if the child doing the OMP succeeded, when starting the tasks.   If it
	failed to run the OMP, then reschedule the task.  The idea is that the
	OMP commands may fail due to low memory or socket timeouts when another
	process is at 100%.  So we retry them if they fail, instead of just
	leaving them, otherwise the task may skip a scheduled run.

	* src/openvasmd.c (fork_connection_for_schedular): Swap parent and child
	so that the caller gets the direct child of itself.

2014-11-14  Matthew Mundell <matthew.mundell@greenbone.net>

	Backport r20851.

	In report formats use abbreviation instead of ISO style for timezone.

	* src/manage_sql.c (print_report_xml): Add TIMEZONE and TIMEZONE_ABBREV.
	(setting_timezone): New function.

	* src/manage.h: Add header accordingly.

	* src/report_formats/HTML/HTML.xsl (openvas:timezone-abbrev): New
	function.
	(date): Use abbreviation instead of ISO style timezone.
	(real-report): Note report timezone.

	* src/report_formats/LaTeX/latex.xsl (openvas:timezone-abbrev): New
	function.
	(format-date, scan_end): Use abbreviation instead of ISO style timezone.
	(abstract): Note report timezone.  Also correct end time of second scan
	in delta case.

	* src/report_formats/TXT/TXT.xsl (openvas:timezone-abbrev): New
	function.
	(date): Use abbreviation instead of ISO style timezone.
	(real-report): Note report timezone.

2014-09-15  Matthew Mundell <matthew.mundell@greenbone.net>

	Backport r20382.

	Get report format dates working when timezone is UTC.

	* src/report_formats/HTML/HTML.xsl (date): New template.
	(scan_start, scan_end): Use date.
	(note, override, real-report): Generate dates with date.

	* src/report_formats/LaTeX/latex.xsl (scan_start, scan_end): Correct
	count.

	* src/report_formats/TXT/TXT.xsl (scan_start, scan_end): Correct count.
	(note, override): Generate dates with scan_start.
	(real-report): Apply scan_start now that it is a matched template.
	Correct location of host start time, and format it like others.

2014-11-14  Michael Wiegand <michael.wiegand@greenbone.net>

	* tools/greenbone-scapdata-sync, tools/greenbone-certdata-sync: Check
	if the current user is indeed the owner of the database and abort
	before doing any write operations if not.

2014-11-07  Matthew Mundell <matthew.mundell@greenbone.net>

	Backport r20820.

	* src/manage_sql.c (task_schedule_iterator_start_due): Check whether
	the "next due time" is 0 before adjusting it for the initial timezone.

2014-11-06  Matthew Mundell <matthew.mundell@greenbone.net>

	Revert backport of r20666.  This patch did not actually help performance
	and would require further backporting to function correctly.

	* src/manage_acl.c (user_owns_result): Link results and reports
	directly.

	* src/manage_sql.c (init_result_iterator): Link results and reports
	directly.

2014-11-06  Matthew Mundell <matthew.mundell@greenbone.net>

	Backport r20805.

	* src/sql.c (sqlv, sql_quiet, sql_x_internal): Use MIN because an upper
	limit is required.  MAX gives a lower limit.

2014-11-05  Matthew Mundell <matthew.mundell@greenbone.net>

	Backport r20666.

	Remove last uses of table report_results.

	* src/manage_acl.c (user_owns_result): Link results and reports
	directly.

	* src/manage_sql.c (init_result_iterator): Link results and reports
	directly.

2014-11-04  Michael Wiegand <michael.wiegand@greenbone.net>

	Post release version bump.

	* CMakeLists.txt: Updated version number to 5.0.6.

2014-11-04  Michael Wiegand <michael.wiegand@greenbone.net>

	Preparing the openvas-manager 5.0.5 release.

	* CHANGES: Updated.

2014-11-03  Timo Pollmeier <timo.pollmeier@greenbone.net>

	Backport r20724.

	* src/manage_sql.c (NVT_INFO_ITERATOR_FILTER_COLUMNS)
	(NVT_ITERATOR_COLUMNS, NVT_ITERATOR_COLUMNS_NVTS): Add "script_tags"
	column, which corresponds to the "tag" column in the database.

2014-10-28  Matthew Mundell <matthew.mundell@greenbone.net>

	Backport r20712.

	* src/sql_sqlite3.c (sql_exec_internal): Add upper limit to retry sleep.

2014-10-28  Matthew Mundell <matthew.mundell@greenbone.net>

	Backport r20705.

	* src/sql.c (sqlv, sql_quiet, sql_x_internal): After a certain number of
	retries, start to sleep between retries.  Sleep for longer as more
	retries happen.  Hopefully this reduces load from retries when a single
	long-running statement is blocking many statements.

2014-10-27  Matthew Mundell <matthew.mundell@greenbone.net>

	Backport r20700.

	Make sure that the delta_states value in reports generated by alerts
	that are triggered by hand matches the given value.  This is purely
	cosmetic because delta reports cannot be generated by alerts.

	* src/manage_sql.c (escalate_2): Add delta_states arg.
	(escalate_1): Add dummy delta_states arg.
	(manage_report): Add delta_states arg.
	(manage_send_report): Pass delta_states arg on to escalate_2, so that
	the same value is used in the filter string of the generated report.

	* src/manage.h: Update header accordingly.

2014-10-27  Matthew Mundell <matthew.mundell@greenbone.net>

	Backport r20695.

	* src/otp.c (process_otp_scanner_input): Set the report and task end
	times before setting the task run status, so that reports generated in
	the associated alerts have the end times.

2014-10-27  Matthew Mundell <matthew.mundell@greenbone.net>

	Backport r20647 by Henri Doreau.

	* src/otp.c (process_otp_scanner_input): In SCANNER_TIME_SCAN_END, stop
	the transaction before calling set_scan_end_time_otp, because it also
	runs a transaction.

2014-10-17  Matthew Mundell <matthew.mundell@greenbone.net>

	Backport r20627.

	* src/manage_sql.c (init_report_host_details_iterator): Use a join
	instead of a subquery, to prevent SQLite from iterating of all NVTs.
	This greatly speeds up the GSA Hosts page.

2014-10-07  Timo Pollmeier <timo.pollmeier@greenbone.net>

	Backport 20535.

	* src/manage_sql.c (init_manage_process): Add PRNG reset for SQLite
	versions older than 3.8.3 as a workaround for SQLite temp file name
	conflicts between forked processes. (Note: This change was originally
	made to src/sql_sqlite3.c (sql_open) in trunk.)

2014-09-26  Matthew Mundell <matthew.mundell@greenbone.net>

	Backport r20493.

	* src/manage_sql.c (TASK_ITERATOR_COLUMNS)
	(TASK_ITERATOR_TRASH_COLUMNS): For next_due, use the
	first_time of the schedule if the schedule is in the past, instead of
	using schedule_next_time which is 0.  This ensures that tasks with
	schedules in the past are sorted by schedule and that they come before
	tasks that have had their schedules removed.

2014-09-26  Matthew Mundell <matthew.mundell@greenbone.net>

	Backport r20485.

	* src/manage_sql.c (TASK_ITERATOR_FILTER_COLUMNS): Add "next_due".
	(TASK_ITERATOR_COLUMNS, TASK_ITERATOR_TRASH_COLUMNS): Add schedule next
	due time as "next_due".

2014-09-26  Matthew Mundell <matthew.mundell@greenbone.net>

	Backport r20484.

	* src/manage_sql.c (TASK_ITERATOR_FILTER_COLUMNS): Add "schedule".
	(TASK_ITERATOR_COLUMNS, TASK_ITERATOR_TRASH_COLUMNS): Add schedule name
	as "schedule".

2014-09-19  Matthew Mundell <matthew.mundell@greenbone.net>

	Backport r20425.

	* src/manage_sql.c (set_task_schedule): Actually calculate next time,
	instead of setting it to first time.

2014-09-18  Benoît Allard  <benoit.allard@greenbone.net>

	* src/otp.h: Fix prototype of process_otp_scanner_input (add parameter)

2014-09-18  Jan-Oliver Wagner <jan-oliver.wagner@greenbone.net>

	Backport r20400.

	* INSTALL: Added prerequisite information for vernice report format.

2014-09-17  Matthew Mundell <matthew.mundell@greenbone.net>

	Backport r20396.

	* src/manage.c (run_task): When resuming a task, keep the slave task
	uuid on the report, because slave_setup (via run_slave_task) needs this
	uuid to resume the task on the slave.

2014-09-16  Matthew Mundell <matthew.mundell@greenbone.net>

	Backport r19367.

	Set the start time of a report once only, the first time the scan is
	started.  This ensures that the start time remains the same, even when

	(scan_start_time_epoch): New functions.

	* src/manage.h: Add headers accordingly.

	exits before the reset_task on error.

	Backport r19351.

	OTP.  Encoded control characters are valid in XML 1.1, but we use 1.0

2013-01-31  Matthew Mundell <matthew.mundell@greenbone.net>

	* src/manage_sql.c (cleanup_manage_process): In the fork process case,
	skip the sqlite3_close because that could affect the same handle in the
	parent.
	(manage_report, manage_send_report): Call cleanup_manage_process after
	forking, and remove the "clearing the parent state" because the added
	cleanup_manage_process will clear task_db.  Thanks to Hani for
	suggesting a change like this.

2012-12-18  Matthew Mundell <matthew.mundell@greenbone.net>

	* src/manage_sql.c (init_note_iterator, init_override_iterator): Remove
	the used_by arg, because the user only ever sees his own notes and
	overrides.

2012-12-18  Hani Benhabiles <hani.benhabiles@greenbone.net>

	* src/omp.c (omp_xml_handle_end_element): Fix alert counts for

	CLIENT_CREATE_ALERT.

2012-12-13  Matthew Mundell <matthew.mundell@greenbone.net>

	Follow overrides flag in task iterator.

	* src/manage_sql.c (TASK_ITERATOR_COLUMNS)
	(TASK_ITERATOR_TRASH_COLUMNS): Add overrides arg.
	(init_user_task_iterator): Pass 0 to columns macros, because
	get->overrides is always 0.
	(init_task_iterator, task_count): Pass the overrides value from the
	filter into the columns macros, so that the threat and trend match the
	overrides flag.
	(init_manage_process): Add extra arg to task_threat_level.

2012-12-13  Matthew Mundell <matthew.mundell@greenbone.net>

	* src/manage_sql.c (init_get_iterator): Drop the owner clause when
	getting a single resource, because the find_resource_for_actions does
	the owner check.  This makes the iterator work again for single
	observed tasks.

2012-12-13  Hani Benhabiles  <hani.benhabiles@greenbone.net>

	Support apply_overrides in GET_TASKS filter.

	* src/manage_sql.c (keyword_applies): Instead of checking only first and
	max, skip over all duplicate keyword columns.  This allows GSA to

	(filter_term_value): Compare with the actual given arg instead of
	"task_id".

	* src/omp.c (get_tasks_data_t): Remove apply_overrides.

	(TASK_ITERATOR_TRASH_COLUMNS): Add last report date as "last", to
	replace report id as "last".

2012-12-10  Matthew Mundell <matthew.mundell@greenbone.net>

	* src/manage_sql.c (TASK_ITERATOR_COLUMNS)
	(TASK_ITERATOR_TRASH_COLUMNS): Add run status name as status so that

	* src/sql.h: Add header accordingly.

2012-12-11  Hani Benhabiles  <hani.benhabiles@greenbone.net>

	Move Port Lists to the new GET object management style.

	* src/manage_sql.c (init_port_list_iterator): Change interface to use

	(get_port_lists_data_reset): Adapt to change in get_port_lists_data_t.
	(omp_xml_handle_start_element): Add ranges and targets attributes. Use
	get_data_parse_attributes.
	(omp_xml_handle_end_element): Adapt to changes in
	init_port_list_iterator and use SEND_GET_START, SEND_GET_COMMON and
	SEND_GET_END macros.

	* src/manage.h: Add and modify headers accrodingly.

2012-12-11  Hani Benhabiles  <hani.benhabiles@greenbone.net>

	into active.
	(REPORT_FORMAT_ITERATOR_COLUMNS): Extract active flag value only from
	flags and rename it into active.

2012-12-11  Hani Benhabiles  <hani.benhabiles@greenbone.net>

	trust_time and flags columns.

	* src/omp.c (omp_xml_handle_end_element): Fixed counter variables for
	CLIENT_GET_REPORT_FORMATS and CLIENT_GET_SLAVES cases. Fixed typo in
	get_next parameter in CLIENT_GET_REPORT_FORMATS case.

2012-12-10  Matthew Mundell <matthew.mundell@greenbone.net>

	* src/manage_sql.c (sql_task_trend, sql_threat_level): When passed a 0
	task just return "", because this happens for count queries when the
	result set is empty.

2012-12-10  Matthew Mundell <matthew.mundell@greenbone.net>

	* src/manage_sql.c (init_get_iterator): When current_credentials.uuid is
	NULL and the resource is owned, then always grant access.  This allows the
	GET iterators to be used by the main process, and before processing the
	client OMP.
	(PORT_LIST_ITERATOR_FILTER_COLUMNS)
	(PORT_LIST_ITERATOR_TRASH_COLUMNS): Flush trailing whitespace.

2012-12-10  Hani Benhabiles  <hani.benhabiles@greenbone.net>

	* src/manage_sql.c (port_list_count): New function.
	(PORT_LIST_ITERATOR_FILTER_COLUMNS, PORT_LIST_ITERATOR_COLUMNS)
	(PORT_LIST_ITERATOR_TRASH_COLUMNS): New defines.

	* src/manage.h (port_list_iterator_exclude): Correct typo. Rename into

	* CMakeLists.txt (OPENVASMD_DATABASE_VERSION): Increase to 70.

2012-12-10  Matthew Mundell <matthew.mundell@greenbone.net>

	* src/manage_sql.c (manage_db_version, set_db_version)
	(init_manage_process, manage_update_nvti_cache, init_manage)
	(nvts_md5sum, set_nvts_md5sum, manage_nvt_preferences_enable): Specify
	the database for the meta table because there is a meta table in the
	SCAP db too.  In particular, this is required before the database is
	created, otherwise the meta in the SCAP makes it look like the tasks
	database has already been created.

2012-12-09  Jan-Oliver Wagner <jan-oliver.wagner@greenbone.net>

	* src/report_formats/HTML/HTML.xsl: Reduced all occurences of
	xsl:with-param where inly a value-of operation was inside to direct
	"select" inside with-param.
	Also reduced all /xsl:param closing tags where content was empty
	anyway. The gain was minimal. This report is fast anyway compared
	to the other report format plugins.

2012-12-09  Jan-Oliver Wagner <jan-oliver.wagner@greenbone.net>

	* src/report_formats/LaTeX/latex.xsl: Reduced all occurences of
	xsl:with-param where inly a value-of operation was inside to direct
	"select" inside with-param.
	This gained clearly less than 1% performance improvement.

2012-12-09  Jan-Oliver Wagner <jan-oliver.wagner@greenbone.net>

	* src/report_formats/TXT/TXT.xsl: Reduced all occurences of
	xsl:with-param where inly a value-of operation was inside to direct
	"select" inside with-param.
	Also reduced all /xsl:param closing tags where content was empty
	anyway. This made the report plugin 4 times faster, measured
	for a very big report (2 hours instead of 8 hours, timed twice
	because I couldn't believe that this little change brings so
	much improvement). Most effect comes from "wrap-line" that
	dropped from #0 to #7 in profiling analysis.

2012-12-08  Matthew Mundell <matthew.mundell@greenbone.net>

	* src/manage_sql.c (manage_report, manage_send_report): Use a fresh "get"
	arg to get the required report format, instead of passing in the "get"
	args from the report iterator.

2012-12-08  Matthew Mundell <matthew.mundell@greenbone.net>

	Get sorting of task columns via filter working.

	* src/manage_sql.c (TASK_ITERATOR_FILTER_COLUMNS)
	(TASK_ITERATOR_COLUMNS, TASK_ITERATOR_TRASH_COLUMNS): Add all columns.
	(init_manage_process): Init new SQL functions task_trend and
	task_threat_level.
	(task_last_report): Make global, so SQL function can use.
	(task_threat_level): Just return NULL if current_credentials is NULL,
	because this could happen now that the function is used via SQL in the
	task iterator.

	* src/manage.h: Add headers accordingly.

	* src/sql.c (sql_task_trend, sql_threat_level): New functions.

	* src/sql.h: Update headers accordingly.

2012-12-07  Matthew Mundell <matthew.mundell@greenbone.net>

	* src/manage_sql.c (count): Move up in file.
	(task_count): Add get arg.  Use count function to return filtered
	count instead of total count.
	(report_format_count, report_format_iterator_trust_time): Flush trailing
	whitespace.

	* src/manage.h: Update header accordingly.

	* src/omp.c (omp_xml_handle_end_element): Disable old TASK_COUNT for now.

2012-12-07  Matthew Mundell <matthew.mundell@greenbone.net>

	* src/omp.c (omp_xml_handle_end_element): In GET_TASKS use
	SEND_GET_START and SEND_GET_END.

2012-12-06  Hani Benhabiles  <hani.benhabiles@greenbone.net>

	* src/omp.c (omp_xml_handle_end_element): Moved closing tag for
	CLIENT_GET_CONFIGS within the appropriate else statement, which was
	causing error responses to append an extra get_configs_response tag.

2012-12-06  Matthew Mundell <matthew.mundell@greenbone.net>

	* src/omp.c (omp_xml_handle_end_element): In GET_TASKS move sending the
	alerts from the detailed case to the common area.  This brings multiple
	alerts to the brief case, which was previously only showing one alert.

2012-12-06  Matthew Mundell <matthew.mundell@greenbone.net>

	* src/omp.c (omp_xml_handle_end_element): In GET_TASKS share the
	creation of PREFERENCES between the brief and detailed cases.  Hence
	remove the brief case, which is now empty.

2012-12-06  Matthew Mundell <matthew.mundell@greenbone.net>

	* src/omp.c (omp_xml_handle_end_element): In GET_TASKS share the bulk of
	the response between the brief and detailed cases.  This removes ALERT
	from the brief case, as there are multiple alerts now.  This also brings
	TRASH to CONFIG, TARGET, SLAVE and SCHEDULE in the detailed case.

2012-12-06  Matthew Mundell <matthew.mundell@greenbone.net>

	* src/omp.c (omp_xml_handle_end_element): In GET_TASKS remove variable
	tsk_uuid, which is out of use.

2012-12-06  Jan-Oliver Wagner <jan-oliver.wagner@greenbone.net>

	Reduce amount of time spent in wrap_row to 0.15% of what
	was spent before. This lets wrap_row drop from #1 to #15
	in profiling analysis (measureing total time spent in function).
	The overall performance gain measured for a very big report was 15%.
	Main reason is that template parameter are expensive, especially
	when used in recursion.

	* src/report_formats/LaTeX/latex.xsl (wrap-row): Drop parameter "color"
	and use white.
	(wrap-row-color): A copy of the old wrap-row with parameter "color".
	(break-into-rows-indented, break-into-rows-indented-color): Dito.
	(break-into-rows, break-into-rows-color): Dito.
	(text-to-escaped-row, text-to-escaped-row-color): Dito.
	All over the code: Were other colors than white were used,
	replace the old call by the -color call.

2012-12-06  Matthew Mundell <matthew.mundell@greenbone.net>

	* src/omp.c (omp_xml_handle_end_element): In GET_TASKS share the
	SEND_GET_COMMON and some variable inits between the brief and
	detailed cases.  This corrects the detailed version when the target,
	slave or schedule is in the trashcan.

2012-12-06  Matthew Mundell <matthew.mundell@greenbone.net>

	* src/omp.c (omp_xml_handle_end_element): In GET_TASKS share the
	creation of SECOND_LAST_REPORT and LAST_REPORT between the brief and
	detailed cases.  This brings the report count optimisation from the
	brief case to the detailed case.

2012-12-06  Matthew Mundell <matthew.mundell@greenbone.net>

	* src/omp.c (omp_xml_handle_end_element): In GET_TASKS for the big if
	share the creation of FIRST_REPORT.

2012-12-06  Matthew Mundell <matthew.mundell@greenbone.net>

	* src/omp.c (omp_xml_handle_end_element): In GET_TASKS add comments
	about result counting.

2012-12-06  Michael Wiegand <michael.wiegand@greenbone.net>

	* src/manage_sql.c (send_to_verinice, send_to_sourcefire): Ensure
	files have the correct permissions when dropping privileges.

2012-12-06  Jan-Oliver Wagner <jan-oliver.wagner@greenbone.net>

	* src/report_formats/LaTeX/latex.xsl (escape_verb_env): Replaced
	this template by a single call of str:replace and therefore removed
	the template and replaced 3-line calls by single line direct execution.
	This improves performance by a few percent.

2012-12-05  Matthew Mundell <matthew.mundell@greenbone.net>

	* src/omp.c (omp_xml_handle_end_element): In GET_TASKS for the big if
	share the creation of RCFILE.

2012-12-05  Matthew Mundell <matthew.mundell@greenbone.net>

	* src/omp.c (omp_xml_handle_end_element): In GET_TASKS for the big if
	share the progress calculation.

2012-12-05  Hani Benhabiles  <hani.benhabiles@greenbone.net>

	Port Report Formats to new GET style.

	* src/manage_sql.c (init_report_format_iterator): Follow the new GET
	style.
	(manage_report, manage_send_report, verify_report_format): Adapt to the
	new init_report_format_iterator.
	(verify_report_format): Use report_format_global instead of
	report_format_iterator_global

	return value of report_format_global, too.
	(report_format_iterator_extension, report_format_iterator_content_type)
	(report_format_iterator_summary, report_format_iterator_description)
	(report_format_iterator_signature, report_format_iterator_trust)
	(report_format_iterator_trust_time, report_format_iterator_active): Use
	GET_ITERATOR_COLUMN_COUNT as base value.
	(report_format_iterator_global): Remove unused function.

	* src/manage.h: Change and remove headers accordingly.

	* src/omp.c (get_report_formats_data_t): Add get_data_t element. Remove
	sort_field, sort_order, report_format_id and trash.
	(get_report_formats_data_reset): Adapt to new get_report_formats_data_t.
	(omp_xml_handle_start_element): Follow new style for GET_REPORT_FORMATS.
	(omp_xml_handle_end_element): Adapt GET_REPORT_FORMATS case for new
	init_report_format_iterator. Send params and file element when details
	attribute is set.

2012-12-05  Matthew Mundell <matthew.mundell@greenbone.net>

	* src/omp.c (omp_xml_handle_end_element): In GET_TASKS for the big if
	share common variables.

2012-12-05  Matthew Mundell <matthew.mundell@greenbone.net>

	* src/omp.c (omp_xml_handle_end_element): In GET_TASKS wrap the big if
	in a block so that common cases can be shared.

2012-12-05  Matthew Mundell <matthew.mundell@greenbone.net>

	* src/omp.c (omp_xml_handle_end_element): In GET_TASKS check the return
	from init_task_iterator.

2012-12-05  Matthew Mundell <matthew.mundell@greenbone.net>

	* src/omp.c (omp_xml_handle_end_element): In GET_TASKS remove the block
	that was used for the initial param check else case, indenting the
	contents in the parent block.

2012-12-05  Matthew Mundell <matthew.mundell@greenbone.net>

	* src/omp.c (omp_xml_handle_end_element): In GET_TASKS give the initial
	param check its own return, to remove the need for the else block.

2012-12-05  Matthew Mundell <matthew.mundell@greenbone.net>

	* src/omp.c (omp_xml_handle_end_element): In GET_TASKS remove the task
	find, because the iterator init does that now.

2012-12-05  Matthew Mundell <matthew.mundell@greenbone.net>

	* src/omp.c (omp_xml_handle_end_element): In GET_TASKS rename variable
	"task" to "index" in the detailed case, to match the brief case.

2012-12-05  Matthew Mundell <matthew.mundell@greenbone.net>

	* src/omp.c (omp_xml_handle_end_element): In GET_TASKS move iterator
	init up and check get.id instead of task.

2012-12-05  Michael Wiegand <michael.wiegand@greenbone.net>

	* src/report_formats/create_signatures: Add quoting in case the RFP
	name contains a space.

2012-12-04  Matthew Mundell <matthew.mundell@greenbone.net>

	* src/manage_sql.c (init_manage): Reset 65536 in port ranges to 65535.

	* src/sql.h: Add header accordingly.

2012-06-26  Matthew Mundell <matthew.mundell@greenbone.net>

2011-11-01  Matthew Mundell <matthew.mundell@greenbone.net>

	* src/manage_sql.c (print_report_xml): In the prognostic case, use the

	accounts for first_result and max_results.

2011-11-01  Matthew Mundell <matthew.mundell@greenbone.net>

	* src/manage_sql.c (print_report_xml): In the prognostic case, calculate
	the filtered total from the other totals, to include the level filtering.

	them after the results, so that all results occur in the one RESULTS
	and all hosts occur in one HOSTS.  Also do the first and max filtering by
	hand instead of passing them to the result iterator, because that only
	works for single hosts.  And count the filtered_result_count by hand too,
	otherwise it includes all threat levels.

2011-11-01  Henri Doreau <henri.doreau@greenbone.net>

	* tools/cpe_getbyname.xsl: Return an empty item if nothing was found.

	owner, because owner is NULL for the example task.

2011-10-25  Matthew Mundell <matthew.mundell@greenbone.net>

	* src/omp.c (omp_xml_handle_end_element): In the brief version of
	GET_REPORTS, move the second last report generation to precede the last
	report.  This allows the counts from the first report to be reused
	correctly.  Also include the second last report in the reuse check of
	the last report.

2011-10-25  Matthew Mundell <matthew.mundell@greenbone.net>

	* src/omp.c (omp_xml_handle_end_element): In the brief version of
	GET_REPORTS, move the first_report_id free to follow the last use, and

	* src/omp.c (omp_xml_handle_end_element): In the brief version, merge the
	false positives count variables into a single variable in a broader scope,
	as is done with the other counts.  Do the same for all the counts of
	second last report case of the brief version.  This ensures that these
	variables are always initialised.

2011-10-24  Matthew Mundell <matthew.mundell@greenbone.net>

	Add to GET_INFO CPE a list of CVEs to which the CPE is vulnerable.

	* src/manage.c (manage_read_info): Add CVEs to CPE.

2011-10-04  Matthew Mundell <matthew.mundell@greenbone.net>

	Migrate the textual times in the db to seconds since the epoch.  Hence
	increase database version to 52.  Add database migration from version 51
	to 52.

	The migrator assumes that the times in the database are in the current
	timezone.  This allows the sysadmin to set TZ to whatever the Scanner has
	been using.

	Made the openvasmd and doxygen- generated documentation aware of the
	svn revision in the same way as the package does already.
	That means, in analogy to the source_package target, only if configured
	with -DPREPARE_RELEASE=1 no revision number will occur in the version
	string.
	Note that this works at configure time, thus you have to execute
	`cmake [OPTIONS] .` to update revision/version numbers in the
	documentation and as answer to `openvasmd --version`.

	* VERSION: Removed, mechanism replaced by cmake-based one.

	* CMakeLists.txt: Do not read in content of VERSION, use
	CPACK_PACKAGE_VERSION instead. Configure the two Doxyfiles.

	wrongly calculated.

	* src/tasks_sql.h (manage_set_config_nvts): Defer determining the old
	NVT count until we know whether the family is growing or not, hand the
	correct growing flag to nvt_selector_nvt_count ().

2009-11-28  Matthew Mundell <matthew.mundell@greenbone.net>

	As a quick way around the very long OMP START_TASK response time, fork
	the manager when starting a task, respond in the parent, and let the
	child slowly start the task.

	* src/manage.c (start_task): Set the task status early, so that other
	processes know that the task is being started.  Check and set the task
	status in an atomic block.  Fork a child to do the bulk of the work, so
	that the current process can return to respond to the client.

	* src/omp.c (current_error, forked): New variables.
	(omp_xml_handle_end_element): Use forked to prevent the client-serving
	process from forking more than once.  Use globals to return fork status
	to process_omp_client_input.
	(init_omp_process): Init forked.
	(process_omp_client_input): Use globals to return fork status to caller.

	* src/ompd.c (recreate_session): If server_socket is zero skip freeing
	the session.
	(serve_omp): When process_omp_client_input has forked create a new scanner
	session in the parent so the child can use the old one, and end the client
	interaction in the child.  Prevent closing and freeing the respective old
	sessions as this would affect the other branch of the fork because the
	actual session is forked.

2009-11-27  Matthew Mundell <matthew.mundell@greenbone.net>

	* src/omp.c (latex_print_verbatim_text): Print equal signs is separate
	verb environments that use dash to begin and end the environment.

2009-11-26  Matthew Mundell <matthew.mundell@greenbone.net>

	Try to stabilise the verbatim LaTeX printing.

	* src/omp.c (next_break): Remove extra nchars-- from "\r" case.  Return
	one more than the newline when a newline ends the line so that the caller
	finds the newline before wrapping.  Try improve the doc comment.  Document
	the code.  Init last_space to -1, as 0 is a valid value for last_space.
	Move the line_width check into the while loop so that it need only be done
	once.  Do the counter increments inside each case instead of decrementing
	just to be incremented.  Make the prefix operators postfix to match the
	rest of the module and general convention.  Use an else for the '\\' case
	instead of breaking in the other branches, to make the behaviour more
	explicit for the reader.
	(latex_print_verbatim_text): Increment pos before calling next_break on
	finding a newline, otherwise next_break will just find the same newline.
	Improve the doc comment.  Document the code.  Do the counter increments
	inside each case instead of decrementing just to be incremented.  Make
	the prefix operators postfix to match the rest of the module and general
	convention.  Use an else for the '\\' case instead of breaking in the
	other branches, to make the behaviour more explicit for the reader.

2009-11-26  Matthew Mundell <matthew.mundell@greenbone.net>

	* CMakeLists.txt: Make formatting more consistent.  Add missing .SVN to
