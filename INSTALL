The reference system used by the developers is Debian GNU Linux 'Etch' 4.0.
The build might fail on any other systems.  Also it is necessary to install
dependent development packages.

Prerequisites:
* openvas-libraries 2.0.0 or greater
* gnutls
* cmake
* sqlite3
* libossp-uuid

Prerequisites for building documentation:
* Doxygen
* xmltoman (optional, for building man page)
* sqlfairy (optional, for producing database diagram)

First, if your openvas/bin is not in your PATH, add it because
libopenvas-config is needed

    $ export PATH=$PATH:/path/to/your/installation/bin/

Then configure the build with

    $ cmake -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=/path/to/your/installation .

or (if you want to use the default installation path /usr/local)

    $ cmake .

This only needs to be done once.  Note: It is assumed that the other
OpenVAS components are installed to the same path. If not, you need to set
some paths separately, see below for details.

Thereafter, the following commands are useful.

    $ make                # build the manager
    $ make doc            # build the documentation
    $ make install        # install the build
    $ make rebuild_cache  # rebuild the make system cache


In case you install openvas-manager to a different path from the other
OpenVAS modules, you might need to set some paths explicitly before running
cmake:

Adjust any values in the Variables section of CMakeLists.txt: The
variables OPENVAS_LIB_INSTALL_DIR and OPENVAS_HEADER_INSTALL_DIR can be
enabled and edited in order to link to a custom installation of OpenVAS.
The certificate and key locations in OPENVAS_SERVER_CERTIFICATE,
OPENVAS_SERVER_KEY and OPENVAS_CA_CERTIFICATE may also need modifying.
