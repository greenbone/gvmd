	Ensure that if a CREATE_TASK fails half way, the new task is removed
	from the database.  Probably the task should be added to the database
	at the end of the CREATE_TASK instead of at the beginning.

	Where necessary, buffer the XML output for a command before queuing it,
	in case there is an error later on in the command.  This way an error
	response could be sent to the client, instead of half a success response
	with a closed connection.  An example is the CLIENT_GET_STATUS case of
	omp_xml_handle_end_element where send_reports could fail after the initial
	part of <get_status_response...> is queued.  A problem with this is that
	some responses are very big, and need to be sent to the client
	incrementally.

	Add function names to log and error messages.

	Convert data going out to the server to 8859-1.

	Handle errors from the SQL properly.

2009-06-12  Matthew Mundell <mmundell@greenbone.net>

	Check carefully that removing a running task works OK.  An OTP SCAN_END
	can arrive at any time, and if the task has been marked for removal the
	SCAN_END handler will remove the task and associated reports immediately.
	This could cause problems if an OMP command is accessing the task or
	reports.

	Use Glib everywhere and use it consistently.  For example, some parts
	of the manager use char* while other parts use gchar*.

2009-06-12  Matthew Mundell <mmundell@greenbone.net>

	Consider the effects of Glib's out of memory handling.  Of special concern
	is the main manager process, where it may be better to try release memory
	than to exit the manager entirely.

2009-06-16  Matthew Mundell <mmundell@greenbone.net>

	In libmanage (src/manage.c), consider separating functions that
	communicate with the server (start_task, stop_task, request_*,
	acknowledge_bye) from data storage and manipulation functions (like
	make_task, next_task, task_name and delete report).

	This could make it easier to use the library outside the manager.
